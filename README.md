In this project, I want to use the feature vector provided by the dataset 
to classify people into healthy and sick categories.

Since we will have two classes, we call it binary classification.

In this project, I implement 7 classification algorithms and train model by dataset.

And finally, I obtain the performance metrics of accuracy, precision and recall 
for all these 7 algorithms and compare them with each other.

Algorithms that were reviewed:
* Naive bayes
* K Nearest neighbors (KNN)
* Decision tree
* Random forest
* Support vector machine (SVM)
* Logistic regression
* Artificial neural network (ANN)
